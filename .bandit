# Bandit security scanner configuration
# This file documents security exceptions and their justifications

[bandit]
# Exclude directories
exclude_dirs = /tests,/venv,/.venv

# Skipped tests with justification
skips = B101,B404,B603,B607

# B101: assert_used
#   Justification: Asserts are used appropriately in tests only
#
# B404: subprocess import
#   Justification: Required for system integration (wl-clipboard, notify-send)
#   All subprocess calls use fixed commands with no user input
#
# B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true
#   Justification: We explicitly avoid shell=True for security
#   All commands use array notation to prevent shell injection
#
# B607: start_process_with_partial_path
#   Justification: System commands (wl-copy, wl-paste, notify-send)
#   are in standard PATH and verified during installation

# Additional suppressions via # nosec comments:
#
# B614: torch.hub.load (src/audio_capture.py)
#   Justification: Loading from official Silero VAD repository
#   Repository: snakers4/silero-vad (verified official source)
#
# B108: /tmp usage (src/config.py, src/hotkey.py)
#   Justification: Unix socket in /tmp with 0600 permissions
#   Standard practice for IPC, limited to user session only
